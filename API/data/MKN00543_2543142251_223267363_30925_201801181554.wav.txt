:	Hello my name is Sheila Brenner I'm crawling on a recorded line on behalf of spectrum may I speak with the head of the household please no this is she. Hi how are you doing today.

:	Good I'm very glad to hear that the reason for my call though is that spectrum is reaching out to residents in your area. We just want to evaluate your current TV phone and internet services to see if we may be able to bring you a better value or price. Who is your current service provider for television.

:	OK. This is not spectrum.

:	Yes this is spectrum but if you do have something with us. The reason I don't know is because I'm from the promotions department and we get to the billing for security reasons OK when I was picked I was so sorry we just don't have access to the billing system for security reasons.

:	But do you have TV phone and internet with us or just TV or just internet or TV phone and you have all three lines with us. OK. Well thank you for your time. Is everything going good with that though. You enjoying it all.
