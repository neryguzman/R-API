:	Time please be with Mike. This is Mike. Hi my name is Amy Bushi. I'm calling today on behalf of spectrum on a recorded line. And do you have a couple minutes for me to ask you some quick questions.

:	I would direct mail and I'm very satisfied.

:	All right. I can certainly understand being satisfied with your current provider and I'm glad for that. Actually we're saving a lot of DirecTV customers like 50 to 60 dollars a month and you have time for me to tell you a little bit about it.

:	I'll pass them on the contract. Don't go wild. I'm going to stay with them.

:	Right. And I certainly understand that but we also offer a contract buyout. If you were interested to like switching services I mean if we can get you and your contract and save you money that would be great. Right.

:	Well good luck to stay with him. I'm doing fine. Oh OK. OK.

:	OK well thank you so much for your time. And if you have questions our number is 8 5 5 7 5 7 7 3 2 8. Have a nice day to celebrate.
