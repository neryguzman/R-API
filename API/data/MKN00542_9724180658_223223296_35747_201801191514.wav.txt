:	I may be good Jerry past. May I ask who's calling because my name is. I'm sorry Ma'am my name is Alexandria Churchill calling on behalf of spectrum before I continue ma'am I do need to let you know this call may be recorded or monitored for quality purposes. We're calling today with two fantastic promotional offers to get you started with spectrum. We love to give you a better value for your money. My record shows that you don't currently have any spectrum services. Correct.

:	Correct. And we are. We are in the process of moving trying to get ready to move. And so right now I don't think that would be a good thing for us. But I appreciate it.

:	Thank you for your time. If you have any questions please feel free to call spectrum 8 5 7 5 7 7 3 2 8 and have a great day. Thank you very much. Thank you.
