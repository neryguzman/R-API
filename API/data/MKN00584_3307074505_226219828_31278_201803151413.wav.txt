:	Yes hello my name is Douglas sprog calling here on behalf of spectrum. How are you doing today. Holmby half of spectrum.

:	And before I continue I do need to let you know this call MAYBE RECORDED OR MONITORED FOR QUALITY purposes. But the reason that we're calling you today is spectrum once you know that you've been selected to receive an exclusive limited time offer that only very few people in your area are going to be offered and my records here show that you don't have any spectrum services. Is that correct.

:	I don't and I don't want to right now. OK. You might have asked you why do you read that. Oh I don't want to add anything on my plate.

:	OK. This may help. Just one quick question before you hang up. Are you currently paying more in 1990 not a month for your internet services. No I'm not. OK. All right well that's all I want to find out then. Well thank you very much for having this brief conversation with me if you have any other questions or comments. It's always 8 6 6 6 4 3 3 3 3 4 thank. All right thank you very much and please enjoy the rest of your day.
