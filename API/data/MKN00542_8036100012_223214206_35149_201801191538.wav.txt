:	Hello. Woods. Yes. This is so calling on behalf of spectrum on a recorded line. How are you. Fine. It's good to hear. Well the reason I'm calling you for giving you an opportunity to bundle some stuff services.

:	We'll have it back to you guys. Thank you. And take me on that list.

:	Is there a reason you left us because of the cost or the service was almost nonexistent.

:	And every time I had somebody come out they'd either sit in their van and smoke a cigarette and say everything's fine or they just had a few buttons. It would work for a day and then it would go back down. So I won't be coming back.

:	Thank you. Well it's really inconvenient for you leave me medially we follow strict policies in regards to the Do Not Call list.
