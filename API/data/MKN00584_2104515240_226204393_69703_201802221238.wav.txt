:	Hi my name is Hannah Fowler on behalf of spectrum formally known as Time Warner. How are you today. Our grain and my call may be recorded for quality assurance. The reason for the quick call today we're calling to make available the best offer that spectrum has ever made on our internet. Right now we're offering for the low price of only 14 dollars and 99 cents a month. That's how much I pay now. I have no idea. Yes Bactrim internet now. Yes. Baby baby already has it. Oh maybe. Well what about the TV and the phone do you have those with us too. Yes yes. OK is everything going good for you. Perfect. OK great. What do you think. But if you were to have any questions or concerns you can always feel free to give spectrum a call at the 808 220 53. We appreciate your business. All right sorry about the call. Don't take your Utu.
