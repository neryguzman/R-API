:	Hi Tom.

:	You're speaking to them what's in my mind.

:	My name is Farah I'm calling on behalf of SEC Chairman before I continue.

:	I do need to let you know this may be a quarter of my quality Pervis about I've got about three calls since I left spectrum in August OK.

:	Hear me. Yes what did I say.

:	I've got about three calls since you left.

:	Yeah from you guys. Now I called two or three times before I came and told Spectrum said Your prices are too high and I got AT&T half the price. Here's 300 cards so I went ahead with that and you guys wouldn't come down. So maybe when this is all up I might call you back.

:	OK. OK. Thank you. Bye no.
