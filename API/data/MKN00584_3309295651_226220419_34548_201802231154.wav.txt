:	Hello. Hello. Am I speaking that this doesn't speak to us. Yes ma'am. How are you doing. BY BYE. This is Tugwell calling on behalf of spackling on the line. What do you say you were planning on going on on behalf of the spectrum. Yeah. With me nothing to do with sex. Yeah ma'am because he's saying that you don't have any spectrum he says the reason I've gone two days a spectrum is for writing a new Internet service to the money. And that is just 14 99 per month. I think it's quite good. What what kind of internet you are having right now. I can understand a word you're saying to start beginning right hearing the bad today OK. Do you having internet at your home. No I don't have anything that calls for Bactrim I'm sorry. Yeah but I mean the spectrum is providing a new is that it is just for 99 per month which is far cheaper than the internet. No I'm not interested in saying thank you. No problem. Thank you. Have a great day.
