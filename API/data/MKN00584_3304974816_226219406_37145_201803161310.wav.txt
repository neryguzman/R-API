Real quick I just need to let you know the call may be recorded for quality purposes but I'm calling you today because my records are showing you do not have any spectrum services is that correct ma'am. What are you wanting. I'm calling for spectrum. My name is Robert Kirk. I'm sorry what. My name is Kurt. OK. We're calling your household to see how. I don't need to watch television. Not at all. What about Internet use. I used to we. Get so many telemarketers that I say were the coroner's office staff. We slap them. Oh my gosh. I don't know. I use limited data because I'm on disability. I'm poor. Well I know I'm doing this stuff. All right well thank you for your time. You have a good day. Bye bye bye.
