Hi my name is Danielle Skinner calling on a recorded line on behalf of Spectrum How are you today. I'm doing great thank you. Wonderful. The reason why I'm calling is to let you know you've been selected to receive an exclusive limited time offer only available to select customers in your area. Now my records show you don't have any spectrum services in your home currently is that correct. That's correct. Right now who are you currently using as far as your Internet service or your home phone service.

:	Oh twenty five dollars. Okay that's wonderful and the home phone services I'm pretty sure it's not is not expensive at all as well right. That's correct. It isn't. OK. And how long is that twenty five dollars going to be for the Dish Network if you know as far as I know there's no to be as long as you don't upgrade it.
