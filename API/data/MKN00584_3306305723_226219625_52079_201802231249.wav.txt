:	Hi Mr. 6. My name is Mary and I'm calling on behalf of spectrum Family Time Warner Cable. And the reason I need to let you know that my comment Mike Turner recorded for quality assurance purposes that we're calling today such. Now you've been selected to receive an exclusive limited time offer only available to customers in your area. My records show you have no Spectrem services in your home correct.

:	Yes we are. And I'm calling today to offer you a package deal including cable phone and internet.

:	Well if you could answer one of my main questions can I have a secure non-public phone number. How did you obtain my number.

:	I could not answer that for you sir. I'm a third party for spectrum.

:	OK well you put me through to a manager. Maybe they can answer that for me.

:	Wait just a moment please. Thank you.

:	Sir. Yes. Is this a cell phone. No it is not. The number has been given to someone somewhere along the line with spectrum aren't TimeWarner.

:	Well I understand that part and that's helping my daughter. I understand that but I'd like to know how it was obtained.

:	And somewhere along the line someone gave it to our company and that is how we got.
