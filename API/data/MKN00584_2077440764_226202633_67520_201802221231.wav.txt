:	Hello. Hello. Hi my name is Alexis. And I'm calling on a recorded line on behalf of spectrum. How are you. I'm fine. How are you. I'm doing well thanks for asking. Spectrum is reaching out to residents in our service area to see if we could provide a better value and price of service in the home. Currently have any cable internet or home phone services.

:	We had that were spectrum healthcare.

:	Oh no spectrum cable is your local cable internet provider. We're not interested in getting service.

:	Are you sure even if we could save the home some money you probably couldn't because we have a Roku box and we don't pay much help.

:	Okay so you only have the Internet service and how much are you paying for the Internet. Because we have a special going on for only 1999 a month. We're happy with what we have but thank you for asking. Okay well if you ever change your mind just give Spectrem a call back here. 8 5 5 7 5 7 7 3 2 8. You have a nice day. Thanks you too. No problem.
