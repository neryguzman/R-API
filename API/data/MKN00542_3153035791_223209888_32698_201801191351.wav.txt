:	Hello is this Mr. Fitzgerald please. This is Andrew Lanc√¥me calling on behalf of spectrum formerly TimeWarner and I'm calling on a recorded line. How are you doing today. I'm doing fine. But I just change from spectrum to rise and thought I'm not interested right now but I appreciate your time and if you have any problems please feel free to call Spectrem at 8 5 5 7 5 773 twenty eight. Thank you.
