:	Hi Can I speak to Mr. Mrs. Smith I'm speaking. Hi my name is Daylin Bell M.. I'm calling on behalf of spectrum. And before I continue I do need to let you know this call may be recorded or monitored for quality purposes. We're calling you today to let you know that you have been selected to receive an exclusive limited time offer only available to select customers in your area and my records show that you don't have any spectrum services in the home currently is this correct. Okay awesome. So Keith how many of you have a current cable provider.

:	No you do not. I do not have cable. OK. I do not own a computer. OK. Goodbye.
