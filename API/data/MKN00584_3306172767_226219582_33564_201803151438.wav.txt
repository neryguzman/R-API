:	Hi my name is Nicole Madison I'm calling on behalf of spectrum today on a recorded line How are you doing today. Well that's good. The reason I'm calling is because we have an exclusive limited time offer for you. As for our Internet access program which is our Internet service high speed at 30 megabits per second download speed and it's only 14 19 a month. That price will stay the same for the first two years and there would be no change in that price at all other than if you needed a wireless router to give you Wi-Fi at your residence to use your devices wirelessly. And that would only be an additional five dollars a month. What kind of things do you like to do on the Internet ma'am. A We have a PC Okay. This would this possibly save you a little bit of money on your internet bill. No I have bundles. Okay I understand. Okay. Well like I said this is only 49 a month and you are eligible for the limited time offer if you would change your mind. I don't think the promotion will last very long but if you change your mind you can always give us a call back and we can try to go ahead and get you set up for that. Okay. Okay okay you call spectrum if you have any questions or concerns at 8 5 5 7 5 7 7 3 2 8 you have a great day.
