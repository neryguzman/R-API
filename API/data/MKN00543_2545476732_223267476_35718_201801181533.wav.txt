:	Hi my name is Greg Thomas. I'm calling on behalf of spectrum. How are you doing today.

:	Well have been terribly sick. Oh that's good. Would you like me to give you a call or some other time. What is this about respect. Do you have any spectrum services at this time. Oh yes.

:	All of them do at the mall that they must have my records not updated correctly because I was supposed to be making calls to people that don't have all three of our services.

:	No I've got ulcerate all the time.

:	Thank you for your time today and I hope you feel better.
