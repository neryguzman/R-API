:	Oh hello.

:	This is Dominic Williams calling on behalf of spectrum and before I continue the lechon that this call will be recorded for quality purposes sorry to cut you off there sir.

:	How are you doing today. I had this call yesterday. You did. It was about the Internet. What about the Internet. We have a promotional offer on our high speed Internet that we were going to extend to you. It's 14 99 right now for the high speed internet. You're with spectrum right now.

:	I respect your person you know I don't know why you're on this list. Then I apologize for that. May I ask you what you're paying currently for your Internet books.

:	I've got water.

:	OK. There is a chance we might be able to repackage it out of that it would be a little bit lower because again I just said 49 89. So that's four four times what I just said you know if you're interested I can maybe try to figure out a way to help you out and get that price down a little bit better than what you're going to own on it.

:	Can I put you on hold for one second sir. Go ahead.

:	Thank you.

:	OK sir I apologize for this call. I guess the money able to. Help you out today in terms of getting your price down. And you know I'm sorry I really am. I don't know anything we can do to help. And if I could do more I definitely would. And I'm sorry but I thank you for your time and your courtesy and if you do have any questions please feel free to call spectrum today 5 5 7 5 7 7 3 2 8 and you have a great day sir.

:	Thanks.
