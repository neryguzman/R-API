:	Mrs. Brown. Yes. John Wilson called for spectrum. How are you. I'm fine. How are you.

:	Oh I'm pretty good thanks for asking. Just call here for again. Call may be recorded or monitored for quality purposes. And I see here actually actually you don't have any of our services ma'am. We'd like to help you out with getting the Internet for only fourteen ninety nine per month more not interested.

:	I appreciate. Do you have another internet right. Do you have any other staff. Have a great day. Please take us off your list.

:	Oh I will certainly do that. Mrs. Brown and I will put your number on our Do Not Call list.
