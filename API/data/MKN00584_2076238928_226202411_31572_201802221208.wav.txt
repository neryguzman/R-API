:	Hello. Hi sir. How are you today. My name is cooling Carpenter and I'm calling on behalf of spectrum on a recorded line. The reason for the call today for is we're calling to let you know that we have a limited time offer to select customers in your area for internet for 40 99 a month. Now that price does not go up on you in a year or two years or three years. It always does the same at fourteen ninety nine a month. It gives you 30 megabits per second so it's ten times faster than standard DSL twice as fast as AT&T. And you know it's a really great rate. We we give you a free modem. Do you own your own modem or do you wrote one now.
