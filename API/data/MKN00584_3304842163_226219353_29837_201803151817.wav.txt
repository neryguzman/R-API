:	Good evening. Could I speak to the head of household or is there a Mr. or Mrs. Wells available that I could talk to. They're not available right now. I take a message. Yes this is Spectrem calling on a promotional call. I do want to tell you the call can be recorded and monitored for quality services. Are you authorized to speak on their behalf.

:	Actually I would be open up with spectrum and they came out here and everything and they said that there was a lot of work to do and it could be up to 60 days or they got it done. Oh OK. But I wish they would hurry up and get it done because I'm still paying a hundred dollar cable bill.

:	OK. So you already have already. Grabbed two of the spectrum services.

:	Well that's not what I have right now. No they have to broaden wire because they're close enough to the house.

:	OK. So they do already have a spectrum technician out there. So there's already a work order for you.

:	I hope so. I mean I've been here three times.
