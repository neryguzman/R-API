:	Oh yes. Can you speak to Stacy. My name is I'm calling on behalf of spectrum. Before I continue I do need to you know call me before her mother.

:	We already have spectrum like the call we've gotten this week and we've got it. I just had a man about ten minutes ago being on the front door. I don't know why you guys don't let me down that I have worked for them already.

:	I just actually do not call me Bill. OK. Perfect. All right thank you.
