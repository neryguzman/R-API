:	Hello Christine. Yes hi my name is Carla myname calling behalf of spectrum on a recorded line. How are you doing today. Fine thanks. I'm actually calling you today to let you know that you have been selected to receive an exclusive offer and Americans so that you don't have any special services in your home. Is that correct.

:	That's correct. But I don't take care of the bill that bills in my mother's name. So I'm not going to make any rule changes right now. All right.

:	Is there a good time. Do you live with the mother who is here.

:	Yeah. We're not going to make any changes right now but I appreciate it.

:	All right. Thank you for your time if you don't have any questions please feel free to call spectrum.
