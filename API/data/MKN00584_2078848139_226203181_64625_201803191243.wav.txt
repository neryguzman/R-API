:	Heiser this is just how calling on behalf of spectrum on a recorded line can you hear me now. Yeah I do apologize. My microphone wasn't working for some reason but before I continue I do need to let you know this call may be recorded or monitored for quality purposes. We're actually just reaching out to your area to let you guys know about a fantastic opportunity we have started for you guys if you don't mind me asking sir do you currently have internet in your home like Wi-Fi or anything. App can and if you don't mind me asking whom is that currently through. Because what we are doing through our company is we decided everyone deserves affordable internet and we are offering our internet for fourteen ninety nine to you then that is nontaxable meaning that would be your price saying if you do need the Wi-Fi router it would only be 1999 and that would be your forever pricing because here is spectrum decided everyone deserves about fordable.

:	I'm sorry what was that we got was bad. Yeah whatever else.

:	Is that through our company or another company company. Okay well if you're interested we do have some triple plays even on cell free that would bring your pricing down probably from what you're currently paying as well.

:	I'm sick with what I got. Thanks anyway.

:	Not a problem. Thank you. If you have any other questions just go spectrum and call back the 4 4 4 3 2 1 1 0 7. Have a wonderful day. You too. Thanks.
