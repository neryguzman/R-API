:	Hello I'm speaking to Alina. Yes hi my name is Carlo and I'm calling behalf of spectrum on a recorded line. How are you doing this morning ma'am.

:	I'm fine. Watch I'm beating my lunch. If it isn't an important call.

:	Actually yes it is because you have a special offer that we would like to give you since you don't have any special services in your home with us. Is that correct.

:	Oh yeah we're all set. Because I've been in a you know retirement village and we were all set. Thank you.

:	You're welcome. Thank you for your time. If you have any questions please feel free to.
