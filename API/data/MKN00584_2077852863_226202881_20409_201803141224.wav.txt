:	Hello. My name is Lisa Santiago and I'm calling on behalf of spectrum on a recorded line. How are you doing today. How are you. I'm good ma'am. Thank you so much for asking. The reason for the call today we are reaching out to residents in our service area. We have some wonderful promotions going on for TV internet and phone but we do have a really good one for internet. It's called the Internet assist program and it's been allowing us to put Internet in the home for only fourteen ninety nine a month. Now my records show you don't have spectrum in the home is that correct. I really do but we're not interested in upgrading. Thank you have a great day. You too. Bye bye.
