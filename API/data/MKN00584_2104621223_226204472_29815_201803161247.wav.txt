:	Hello. Hello. My name is Leslie Armis I'm calling on behalf of spectrum. How are you doing today. Thank you. That's good to hear. Before I continue I do need to let you know this call may be monitored for quality purposes. But the reasons that I'm calling we have spectrum services available in your area what it is is we have cable internet and home phone.

:	Are you currently on. We already have a spectrum. Were very pleased with that. And you all do great service so much so you have all three services with us. No my husband prefers to have the other ones separate and have the phone and we have the TV and I think he has the other separate but I just we're just very pleased and we want to thank you so much. No problem. Thank you for your time. You have a great day ma'am. Bye bye.
