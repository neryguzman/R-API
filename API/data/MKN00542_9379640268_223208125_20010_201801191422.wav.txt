:	Hello. Thank you. You know David speaking I hope your timeline is very low. I'm calling on behalf of spectrum before I continue doing this. Call me America show that you have and respect me no longer. Why. Because we went on vacation and now can't afford it. OK how much are you paying for. It shows that in front of you shouldn't. If you're calling from spectrum you have that actually all we have is a promotion because spectrum is with much of phone internet and landline for ages 9 7. We can't do that. How much just for the internet for you for that I knew going for 100 meg. Sixty six to 100.

:	I don't know but if I transfer you I can you can get that information from the verifier if you're interested you can set up industry or you can hang out. I think you're great. OK. Give me one second from your transfer. Thank you.
