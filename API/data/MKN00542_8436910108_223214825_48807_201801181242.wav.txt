:	Hi good afternoon. My name is Stephanie Tafoya. I'm calling on behalf of the spectrum on a recorded line. How are you. That's great to hear. Ma'am the purpose for the call is first and foremost I do want to thank you for answering the phone to me today and we're calling with some fantastic promotional offers to get you started with spectrum. We'd love to give you a bag already. I already have spectrum. Thank you. OK go ahead. Not that I apologize for any inconvenience. Is everything working OK. Yes. Thank you very much. Have a good day.
