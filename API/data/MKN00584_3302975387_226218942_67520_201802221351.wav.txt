:	Hi my name is Alexis McLean and I'm calling on a recorded line on behalf of spectrum. How are you. I'm fine thank you. That's good. Right now spectrum is reaching out to residents in our service area to see if we could provide a better value and price to service.

Well if you are interested in the future we have internet and Wi-Fi for only nineteen dollars and 99 cents a month and you could give us a call back at 8 5 5 7 5 7 7 3 2 8 when you're ready. OK.
