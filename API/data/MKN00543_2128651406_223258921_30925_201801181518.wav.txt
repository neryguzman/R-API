:	Hi my name is Caleb Bruner. I'm calling on a recorded line on behalf of spectrum may I speak to the head of the household. Please take my name off this list. We're not interested. Thank you. I can certainly do that. I will put your number on our Do Not Call list. Let me verify your telephone number. We do everything we can to remove it within seven days but it may take up to 30 as a little by law. So you may receive additional calls in that time. But thank you for your time today if you have any questions feel free to call Spectrum 7.
